<p><b>Can VAERS Data Demonstrate Causality?</b></p>

<P>One person who has taken a strong stance against the claim that VAERS data cannot tell us anything about causation is Steve Kirsch, executive director of the <b>COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund</b>. In the video <b>“Vaccine Secrets: COVID Crisis,”</b> he argues that VAERS can indeed be used to determine causality.</p>

<p>It’s important to realize that the idea that VAERS cannot show causality is part of how and why the CDC can claim none of the deaths is attributable to the COVID shot. Kirsch argues that this premise is in fact false, and that causation can be determined using VAERS’ data.</p>

<p>To prove his point, Kirsch gives the following analogy: Suppose you give a two-dose vaccine. After the first dose, nothing happens, but after the second dose, people die within 24 hours of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).</p>

<p>When you look at the VAERS data, what you would find is no reports associated with the first dose, and a rash of deaths after the second dose, all within the same timeframe and with the same cause of death.</p>

<p>According to the CDC, you cannot ascribe any causality at all from that. To them, it’s just random chance that everyone died after the second dose, and from the same condition, and not the first dose or from another condition.</p>

<p>Kirsch argues that causality can indeed be identified from this kind of data. It’s very difficult to come up with another explanation for why people — many who are young, in perfect health with no predisposing conditions — die exactly 24 hours after their second dose. It’s even difficult to come up with another explanation for people who do have underlying conditions.</p>

<p>For example, is it reasonable to assume that people with, say, undiagnosed heart conditions, would die from DVT exactly 24 hours after getting a second dose of vaccine? Or that people with undiagnosed diabetes would die from DVT exactly 24 hours after their second dose?</p>

<p>Why not after the first dose, or two months after the second dose, or any other random number of hours or days, or for other random cause of death? Why would people randomly die of the same condition at the exact same time, over and over again?</p>

<p>At bare minimum, as an early warning system, VAERS is designed to flag potential causation. It’s by looking for repeated patterns of side effects that you would begin to identify a potentially problematic vaccine. Once a pattern is identified — and there’s no denying death within 24 hours to one week is a pattern seen for the COVID shots — an investigation should be launched.</p>

<p>But no such investigation has been launched for the COVID jabs. Clear-cut patterns are simply ignored. As an early warning system, VAERS is performing as intended, despite severe underreporting (the CDC recently published a paper in which they admit COVID jab adverse effects in children are underreported by a factor of 6.519). It’s the follow-up that’s lacking. But lack of investigation and follow-up is not evidence that the shots can’t cause death.</p><br>

<p>
<b>The Temporal Connection</b></P>
<p>
<ul>

<li><b>Research : </b><a href="lethalinjection.pdf" target="_blank">Most adverse effects occur within 24 hours of vaccination</a></li><br>



<li><b>Pfizer Leak : </b>A document, pryed out of Pfizer using a Freedom of Information Request, describes 1209 serious cardiac events between December 1st 2020 and Feb 28th 2021. Here is the report. In the image below, Pfizer admits that these events occurred up to 21 days after the vaccination, BUT THE MEDIAN is less than 24 hours !  See - <a href="pfizerleak.pdf" target="_blank">Pfizer Leak - see p 16</a> . See also <a href="https://www.peakprosperity.com/pfizer-safety-data-released-and-its-not-good/" target="_blank">Chris Martenson analyses Pfizer safety data for first 90 days of deployment</a></p>

<p>In the light of this information, derived from both VAERS and directly from Pfizer, it is confirmed that most of the adverse events occur within 24 hours of vaccination. </P></li><br>

<p><img src="24hr.png" vspace = "0" hspace="0"  ALT="Are some batches more toxic than others?" width="600" height="400"></img> <a href="pfizerleak.pdf" target="_blank">Pfizer Leak - see p 16</a> </p><br>



<li><b>Govt Hiding the Truth : </b>It is therefore alarming that the governments should seek to hide this close temporal connection by declaring that all people are "unvaccinated" within 14 days of the vaccination ! See - <a href="thegreatdeception.pdf" target="_blank">The Great Deception</a>
</li><br>

<li>The 14 day rule hides a vast increase in mortality amongst the vaccinated - and this is subsequently demonstrated by empirical studies - <a href="https://www.riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/modern-day-censorship/covid-19-german-professor-uncovers-alarming-pattern-in-mortality-data-is-there-a-link-between-vaccination-and-excess-mortality/" target="_blank">Report</a></li><br>

<li>For more information see <a href="time.html" target="_blank">Time Till Onset</a></li>

</ul></p><br>


<p><b>The Spatial Connection - (distribution)</b><br></p>
<p>If the vaccine is causing the adverse reactions, then these adverse reactions should increase in number in proportion to the amount of vaccine distributed -</p>
<ul>
<p>See <a href="sizematters.html" target="_blank">Size Matters</a><br><br>
See also <a href="paralysis.html" target="_blank">Paralysis</a></p>
<li>As number vaccinated in each State increases, so do adverse events.</li><br> 
<li>As lot size increases, so do adverse events for that lot</li><br>
<li>Degree of vaccination in any country should be proportional to excess mortality and adverse events

</ul>
</p>

<p>This is called a "direct proportion" relationship. When one thing increases, so does the other, because there is a causal relationship between them. In this case, the bigger the lot size - the more doses given - the greater the number of adverse reactions caused. </p>
<p>We don't know the sizes for all of the lots, but we have the sizes for some - a Pfizer document lists the sizes for 33 lots. When we use VAERS to count the number of adverse reactions associated with each of these lots, we find that as lot size increases, so does the number of injuries caused - showing that the vaccines are causing the injuries.</p><br>

<p><b>Mortality Rises Following Vaccination</b></p>

<p>According to OneAmerica, a national life insurance company based in Indianapolis, in the third quarter of 2021, working-age Americans (aged 18 to 64) died at a rate that is 40% higher than the prepandemic rate, and they didn’t die from COVID.</p>

<p>And, according to CEO Scott Davidson, this catastrophic abnormality is consistently seen “across every player” in the life insurance industry. A 40% increase in mortality is simply unheard of, and as of yet, they claim to have no clue as to what’s causing young and middle-aged people to die prematurely at such an astounding rate.</p>

<p>Looking at it from a sleuth’s point of view, one might ask, “What environmental factor with unknown safety was introduced in 2021 to people in this age group?” Sure, pandemic restrictions have led to spikes in drug overdoses and suicides, which affects this cohort in particular. But “deaths of desperation” cannot account for all of it.</p>

<p>The one wild card is the COVID jab. More than 173 million working-age Americans (18 to 64) got these experimental gene transfer injections, and doctors and scientists have elucidated several mechanisms by which they might injure or kill.</p>

<p>What’s more, the rise in deaths began AFTER the rollout of the shots, and whatever the causative factor, it is not only national but likely international in scope. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, for example, also reports a 41% rise in death claims in 2021.</p>

<p>Excess deaths (exceeding prepandemic norms) are also reported in the U.K. Among teens (aged 15 to 19), mortality spiked right after teens became eligible for the COVID shot. Between the week ending June 26 and the week ending September 18, 2020, and that same period of time in 2021, teenage deaths rose by 47%.</p>

<p>A rise in disability claims also suggests that many who aren’t killed by this novel lethal threat are seriously injured, often long-term. For all of these reasons, the COVID jabs cannot be taken off the table. Logic demands that they be looked into as a potential causative factor.</p><br>

<p><b>Intention as Causation</b></p>
<p>Intention is causation - because it precedes the intended effects. If there is intention to harm, then it follows that harmful effects will follow when that intention is acted out</p>
<p>So has the government demonstrated intention to harm?</P>
<p>Here is a list of evidences -</p>
<ol>
<li>despite excessive deaths and disabilities caused, the government has not stopped to investigate, neither has it suspended the use of these vaccines until these issues are resolved</li>
<li>the governments removed our only safe-guard against pharmaceutical malpractice by nullifying any responsibility for injuries caused and exempting pharma of any liability.</li>
<li>the governments have suppressed information about adverse reactions, and censored the testimonies of the vaccine injured</li>
<li>the government have suppressed the use of safe alternative medications</li>
<li>the governments have used coercive techniques to push the vaccine including lockdown, masking, repeated testing, restrictions on movement, travel, employment, education, access to social venues, and access to medical help</li>
</ol>
<p>It has been adequately demonstrated that COVID19 vaccines are followed by excessive deaths and disabilities. Whatsmore, these deaths and disabilities are greater for some lots compared to others, greater for some countries compared to others, and greater for women compared to men. Despite these numerous safety signals, the government has not investigated the causes, neither have they suspended the vaccine rollout until these issues are resolved. Instead they have proceeded with the vaccination of ever more vulnerable groups - children and infants. Furthermore they have suppressed information about adverse reactions, deaths and disabilities on main stream media, and censored social media - and used coercive policies to force employers to mandate the vaccine upon their employees. It is therefore obvious that their intention is not to warn us of potential risks posed by the vaccines - consequently their intention is not to help us avoid harm. Since the governments knows full well the hazardous consequences of COVID vaccinations, therefore they are not acting out of ignorance. Their intention is deliberate and in full knowledge of the consequences</P>

<p>Intention precedes the intended effect, so intention is a cause. The manifest and obvious intention to harm is the strongest possible evidence that the intended action (vaccination) is harmful. The HOW, WHEN and HOW MUCH are simply details that will become more obvious with time.</P><br>

<li><a href="tcelldepletion.pdf" target="_blank">Vaccine Depletes Immune Cells</a></li><br>

<li>Curiously, analysis of blood from some vaccinated subjects shows an odd phenomenon. Granulocytes (immune cells) appear to be attacking each other. I include their report with no comment except that this is unexpected and very odd - it appears that in some cases the immune system is attacking itself - <a href="gc-after.pdf" target="_blank">Granulocytes Self Attack</a></li>

<p><A recent histopathologic analysis of the organs from 15 patients who died within seven days to six months’ post-jab, ages 28 to 95, found 14 of the deaths — 93% — were caused by the jab. None of the original coroners’ reports implicated the shots, however.</p>

<p>The association was only established through autopsy, which revealed a “process of immunological self-attack” that is “without precedent.” “Because vaccination was the single common denominator between all cases, there can be no doubt that it was the trigger of self-destruction in these deceased individuals,” Drs. Sucharit Bhakdi and Arne Burkhardt wrote. See <a href="autopsy.pdf" target="_blank">Autopsy Study</a></p>
</ul>
</p>



<br>
<P><B>Micro-Clotting Always Occurs</B></P>
<P>The spike protein, when added to healthy blood, induces clotting with a mechanistic certainty. Take ANY healthy blood, add a few drops of Spike protein, and it will clot - because the Spike protein is a clotting agent. It is not a question of IF, but only of HOW MUCH. When tested with the D-DIMER test, micro-clots have been found to occur in 62% of people vaccinated. </p><br>

<P><B>Effects of Micro-Clotting</B></P>


<P>Clotting leads to an attentuation of blood to tissues - obviously resulting in cell death and tissue damage. A tissue deprived of blood, and of the vital oxygen and nutrients that blood provides, will be damaged. This damage will be pervasive - occurring in what ever tissue is exposed to the spike-producing LNPs within the vaccine. </P><br>
<p><ul>
<li>If blood vessels are exposed, the result will be inflammation and clotting of those blood vessels.</li><br>
<li> If nerve cells are deprived of blood, then the result will be nerve damage. - experienced as paralysis, motor impairment, tremors, dysregulation of movement. </li><br>
<li>If brain cells are deprived of blood, then the result will be impairment of cognitive ability, brain fog - stroke. </li><br>
<li>If major arteries are blocked by clots the result will be heart attack. </li><br>
<li>If microclots occur in the blood supply to the eyes, the result will be impairment of vision - sometimes permanent blindness in one or both eyes</li>
</ul></p>
.
<P>Even when clotting does not produce damage to vital organs, it will result in a decline of health, experienced as a faster onset of fatigue, incapacity to sustain effort, difficulty in maintaining activities.</P>
<br>

<P><b>People Can See the Connection</b></p>
When people die or become disabled within 24 hours of vaccination, people notice. The onset of the symptoms leading to their death is often immediate. Common sense tells them there is a connection. They know. </p>
<p>The testimonies of these people is further evidence of the connection between the vaccines and adverse effects.</p>
