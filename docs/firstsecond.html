<p><b>Pfizer Study</b></p>
<P>Pfizer's study showed that the second dose had worse effects than the first.  See - <a href="https://howbad.info/incremental.pdf" target="_blank">Pfizer Study</a></P><br>


<p><b>First and Second Doses in VAERS USA 2021</b></p>
<p>I wanted to investigate this using VAERS - to see if the second dose produced a higher % of severe adverse reactions than the first dose</P>


<p>So I filtered VAERS 2021 USA for 1st dose, then for 2nd dose, and each time I counted the number of deaths, disabilities and life threatening illnesses produced.</p><br>

<P>
<ul>
<li><b>First Dose : </b>Total reports = 372891 ; Deaths = 4774 ; Disabilities = 5552 ; Life Threatening Illnesses = 5036 ; severe reports = 4.12% of total.</li><br>
<li><b>Second Dose : </b>Total Reports = 199968 ; Deaths = 2772 ; Disabilities = 4152 ; Life Threatening Illnesses = 3689 ; severe reports = 5.31% of total.</li>
</ul>
</p><br>
<p>So 1 in 25 of the reports for the first dose record death or serious injury, compared to 1 in 20 of the reports for the second dose.</p>

<p>The main reason for the increase in severity for the second dose is the big increase in disabilities per 100,000 - </p><br>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>First Dose : </b> Disabilities per 100,000 = 1489 </li><br>
<li><b>Second Dose : </b>Disabilities per 100,000 = 2076</li>
</ul>
</p><br>

<p>I decided to repeat the exercise, but this time for each month of 2021 to see how the percentages varied</p><br>

<p><img src="dosesmonth3.png" height="1000" width="600"></img></p><br>
<p>There is no evidence that the second dose is consistently worse than the first, or that the third is consistentlty worse than the second. </P>

<p>There is variability in the % of severe reactions associated with each dose </p>
<p><br><ul>
<li><b>Dose 1 : </b> 1.67 to 5.22%</li><br>
<li><b>Dose 2 : </b> 1.6 to 7.39% </li><br>
<li><b>Dose 3 : </b> 0.97 to 5.62% </li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>

<p><b>Decreasing Severity over Time</b></p>
<p><b>First dose</b> remained in the 4-5% range from January until october, then decreased in severity since then.</P>
<p><b>Second dose</b> decreased in severity progressively since February.</p>
<P><b>Third dose</b> started properly in August, and decreased in severity progressively since then.</p>

<p>This analysis does not take into account the vast number of cases of injury that are not classified as disability, e.g. paralysis, haemorrhage, heart attacks, arthritis, herpes, auto-immune illness, tremors, etc It merely suggests that the doses do not have a cumulative or summative effect in producing death or disability.</p>

<p>It looks as if initially pharma had issues with introducing the second dose - the second dose looks as if it was producing a compounding or cumulative effect with the first dose. However by July this was nolonger the case, and since August the second dose has produced fewer deaths and disabilities than the first.</p>

<p>There is a decrease in severity of the doses as time passes. This confirms other studies that have indicated a decrease in toxicity as alphabetic batch codes ascend. See - <a href="clusters.html" target="_blank">Clusters</a></p><br>


<p><b>Are more Recent Batches Safer?</b></p>
<p>This does not mean that more recent vaccine batches are safer, because I am only looking at death and disability. These are just tips of an iceberg. What does not kill you or disable you, can still cause extensive internal damage - and this has to be investigated before deciding on safety. For example - these vaccines have been shown to cause nerve damage and clotting, neither of which are classified as death or disability. </p><br>

<p><b>How Confident Am I in These Results</b></p>
<p>Given the large number of records for each dose, I would say that this impression of a decreasing severity is unlikely to change as more records are added.</p><br>

<p><b>Decreasing Interest In Vaccines</b></p>
<p>If the number of adverse reactions is directly proportional to the number of people being vaccinated, then the total number being vaccinated has decreased since March - this January it looks as if the numbers being vaccinated are only one tenth of those vaccinated last January. This may reflect a growing resistance to future doses.</P><br>

<p><b>More Doses Every Year?</b></p>
<p>VAERS contains records of people receiving 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th doses - indicating that the governments intend a regular dosing regime if people are to be allowed their freedoms. The pattern over 2021 appears to be testing of future doses with low numbers followed later by their full scale introduction. We see how in January they were already testing their third dose, in July they were testing their 4th, and in August their 5th. This January they are already testing their 6th and 7th. </P><br>
