<P><b>Variation in Toxicity of Vaccine Batches Across Different States of the USA</b></p><br>

<P><b>Data Sources</b></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>VAERS provided the number of deaths  following vaccination with Pfizer for each state in the USA.</li><br>

<li>The number of vaccinated in each state as of January 14th 2022 was provided by - <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/states-ranked-by-percentage-of-population-vaccinated-march-15.html" target="_blank">number vaccinated</a>. So I was able to calculate the number dying in each state per 100,000 vaccinated.</li>
</ul>
</p><br>

<P><b>Observations</b></p>
<ul>
<li>There is considerable variation in the number dying per 100,000 vaccinated. Some states have 16 x the death rate compared to others. </li><br>

<li>Red states tend to cluster towards the top of the chart, whilst blue states cluster towards the bottom. </li><br>

<li>Red states occupy 6 of the 7 highest ranking positions for deaths per 100,000 vaccinated</li>
</ul></p><br>

<P><b>Safety Signal</b></p>
<p>Some states, in particular Kentucky, Montana, Alaska, Tennessee, North Dakota and South Dakota are experiencing 4 x, 5 x, 6 x or even 11 x the number of deaths per 100,000 vaccinated compared to other states. Such a situation should be raising a safety signal, and requires investigation. The higher death rate in these states following vaccination suggests that they may be receiving more toxic batches, or being administered to more vulnerable people. </p><br>

<font size="-2"><b>Data from VAERS for 2021 USA for Pfizer vaccine only</b></font><br>
<font size="-2">Column 2 = Number of deaths following vaccination</font><br>
<font size="-2">Column 6 = Number of people vaccinated</font><br>
<font size="-2">Column 7 = Deaths per 100,000 vaccinated</font></p><br>


<P><b>Repeating the Analysis for All Covid Vaccines</b></p>
<P>Based on the findings for Pfizer, I decided to repeat the analysis, but this time for all of the covid vaccines together. Here is what I found.</p><br>



<p><img src="deathsstate.png" width="500" height="1000"></img><br><br>
<font size="-2"><b>Data from VAERS for 2021 USA for Pfizer, Moderna and Janssen vaccines</b></font><br>
<font size="-2">Column 2 = Number of deaths following vaccination</font><br>
<font size="-2">Column 6 = Number of people vaccinated</font><br>
<font size="-2">Column 7 = Deaths per 100,000 vaccinated</font></p><br>


<p>A clearer pattern emerges. Red states are almost completely clustered at the top, and blue states at the bottom. Number of deaths per 100,000 vaccinated is much higher for red states. </P>

<P>The only possible reasons for this are either - </p>
<ol>
<li>red states are receiving batches of higher toxicity OR </li>
<li>the uptake in red states is predominantly amongst the elderly and frail.</li>
</ol>
</p><br>
<P><b>Testing the Age and Frailty Factors</b></p>
<p>I will have to investigate this further - by analysing the spread of ages for vaccinated between states. VAERS also provides a list of comorbidities for each recipient's report, so I can test for frailty also.</p>
<P>(Note: If age and frailty are responsible for the increased deaths following vaccination in red states, then this is an admission that the aged and frail must be more vulnerable to the fatal effects of the vaccine - since red states have upto 19 x the fatality rate. And if the aged and frail are more vulnerable to this medication then they should be <b>protected from it,</b> and exempt from it. If any demographic is excessively vulnerable to a medication, then they should not be exposed to it - continuing the medication betrays an intent to harm.)</P><br>

<P><b>Age</b></p>
<p>Here is a box plot showing the ages of all those dying after vaccination in each state</P>

<p><img src="agestate.png" width="900" height="700"></img></p><br>

<P><b>The Aged Are Definitely More Vulnerable</b></p>
<p>As you can see, the <b>average age</b> for those dying after vaccination is over 60 years old in all states, except for Nevada and Columbia. Broadly speaking 25% are aged 40-60, 75% are aged 60 +. So age is definitely a factor - old people are vulnerable to the effects of the vaccine across all states - the vaccine kills them far more readily than it kills young people. For this reason, old people should not be exposed to the vaccine, but rather should be protected from it. This is a major safety signal.</p>

<p>If it is mainly the old who are dying after the vaccination, then the higher number of deaths in red states per 100,000 vaccinated  indicates that there are more old people per 100,000 being vaccinated in those states. </P?

<p><b>Calculation</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The average number of deaths for red states is 5.44 deaths per 100,000 vaccinated</li>
<li>The average number of deaths for blue states is 3.46 deaths per 100,000 vaccinated</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>So the ratio of red:blue is 5:3</P><br>

<p>This means that for every 5 old people vaccinated in a red state, there will be 3 old people vaccinated in a blue state</p>

<p>There does not seem to be much difference in age for those dying after vaccination between red and blue states - the age range is much the same from one state to another. It is the number of old vaccinated that makes the difference</p><br>


<p><b>Differences in Disability Following Vaccination</b></p>
<p>These vaccines tend to afflict the old with death (terminal disability), and to afflict younger age groups with severe injury or chronic illness (non-terminal disability). After all, death is just extreme disability, so the young and strong may survive but with disability instead.</p>

<p>In the box plot below, I have plotted the age ranges for all people acquiring disability in each state of the USA following vaccination. As you can see, the age range is definitely lower. About 25% of the disabilities occur in the age range 20-40, and 75% occur in the age range 40+. So the age range of vulnerability has dropped by about 20 years.</P><br>


<p><img src="disabilitystates.png" width="1000" height="800"></img></p><br>

<p><b>Distribution of Disability Across States</b></p>

<p>When we look at the distribution of disability across states we find a reversal of the previous spread. Now there is a concentration of blue states at the top, and red states at the bottom. A larger number of younger age groups are being vaccinated in blue states compared to red states, so there is a correspondingly larger number of people becoming disabled. </p><br>
<p><img src="disabilitystate.png" width="500" height="1000"></img></p><br>

<p>In some states the absolute number of cases of disability following vaccination is very high. For example California has had 1344 cases. </P>
<p>Curiously, in the District of Columbia the vaccine kills younger people than in other states, and also causes more disabilities amongst younger people</p>
